Post-rendering refers to the process that occurs after the initial rendering of a website in the browser. It involves updating the page dynamically in response to user actions, such as clicking buttons or scrolling the page.

User-induced execution is the process by which user actions trigger JavaScript code to run, which then updates the page dynamically. For example, when a user clicks a button, the JavaScript code associated with that button is executed, and the page is updated in real-time without the need for a page refresh. This allows for a more dynamic and interactive experience for the user.
